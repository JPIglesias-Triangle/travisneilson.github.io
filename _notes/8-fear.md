I'd like to talk about fear for just a bit. 

Fear keeps you from acting. It's as simple as that. I think you can, if you are being honest, accept that the reason you opened this email this morning is because there is something more important you are not doing.

Something I've learned over the years is that creative block is based in fear, not a drought of ideas. I take special pride in being a maker. I know the resistance of the blank page. Not a single one of the many many projects I've abandoned were done so as a result of a lack of inspiration.

There are a number it's things I could advise to battle resistance, and I'm sure that they will pop up in this email sometime, but right now I just want to point out that you need safety to act fearless.

Safety comes in a variety of flavors. Sometimes it's the encouragement of a friend or collaborator. Sometimes it's constructive feedback from a community online. Sometimes it's your boss, who believes on you.

When the conditions are so that fear of failure is not a part of the equation, you can open yourself up to making something wonderful. You can give in to creative flow and produce the best work of your life.

Sometimes no safety can be found externally. These are moments that require bravery and confidence. In a real way; you need to be the safety that you need. Sometimes, safety can only come from within.

The best creative accomplishments are a result of bravery.

I mentioned in my last note that the act of writing to you took me a great deal of courage. When I take time to compose my thoughts and and then send them to you, I'm putting myself in a vulnerable place. Most of the people who receive these notes are gracious and kind, yet every time I send I know there will be  more people who decide they don't want this anymore and unsubscribe. I get those notifications. If I let them, they could scare me into not sending; into being quiet.

But you put your head down, brace for the pain, and keep making and sharing things that make you happy.

What are you putting off as a result of fear? What small steps can you take to break that fear down; take away it's power?

Thanks for reading, I'd like to send you more thoughts as they come. If you are not excited about that please in subscribe and we can catch up another way. 

Until next time,

Travis
