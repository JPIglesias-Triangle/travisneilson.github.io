It happens every year. To you, to me, to everyone.

But today it's my turn. Wake up, rub the sleep out of my eyes. Reach for my phone on the nightstand. Where the hell is the snooze button? Swipe it? Power off? Ugghhh. What day is it?

Oh yea. It's my birthday.

I used to love this. I thought it was special — thought I was special. When did I start dreading my birthday? Feel like I've always been old. Even when I was nineteen. That's right, even when I was young, I was old.

I'm into numbers. Into the stories that numbers tell me. I design data for a living for goodness sakes. I like to put things into a perspective that I can understand. Achievement. Cause and effect. Goals. Outcomes.

Each year I try to relive my life and understand how I landed here. How I lucked out so hard. The year before last I told myself the story of my life in terms of music. I made a public playlist of all the songs that have made their impression on my life. From the embarrassing to the "I should be embarrassed, but I'm not."

I like to take pictures of myself too. Last year I took a photograph of my face for every year that I've been alive. I used one as my computer desktop. I looked like a deer in headlights. Near the bottom corner was an inscription: "11323 days down, 20453 days to go." That's right. I know it's morbid. But there is something incredibly motivating to me about it. I only have a finite number of days(chances) left. Make the most of it.

I don't celebrate birthdays like you probably do, like most people I know. I don't want a party or to go out for drinks with friends. I don't want presents or a cake (although I probably do want the cake, on second thought.) 

I want to be alone on my birthday. I want to isolate myself and remember my entire life.

I want to remember being that little kid who didn't understand why we left.

I want to remember being the teenager who felt incredibly stupid and could only mutter, "I don't know, I'm sorry" when the teacher made him stand up in front of the class.

I want to be that young man who kept a sleeping bag and a swimsuit in his car trunk, who went on adventures at the drop of a hat.

I want to remember why I asked her to marry me, what I felt when she gave me my first child.

I like having my birthday at the end of the year. It's a great time to reflect — to measure and plan.

This is a pre-composed note. I wrote this a week ago, and scheduled it on my birthday so that you would know that I'm older now.

So that you would be reminded that you are next.
