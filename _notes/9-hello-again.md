I appreciate you.
That's the thought that keeps bouncing around my head.
Let me backup for a moment. Do you know know who I am? At some point in the past you signed up for my newsletter on travisneilson.com. If you are confused by this email; I'm sorry. Please feel free to use the unsubscribe link at the bottom. No hard feelings.

So, hello. Again.

Here I sit. I'm in between editing two videos and a podcast. I have two freelance projects on my plate that wont seem to end ... and yet I just keep thinking about you. I have no idea who you are. But somewhen you stumbled along and dropped your email address in my inbox.

To me — this is magic!

And yet! Yet ... yet, I don't ever talk to you.

Why? I don't have a clue. It's like when you were in school and you found out that the cute girl in class knows who you are. It's such a cool feeling. You felt like the king of the world — but you wouldn't dare talk to her. A combination of the nerves and the idea that if you spoke to her and said something foolish she'd find out how big of a dork you are and change her mind. Vow never to speak to you again.

So it's better to have the idea of your attention, than to have an open line of communication.

Strange that, eh?

Now, full circle. What is the point of this vociferation? Well, simple. I've already said it: I appreciate you. I just wanted you to know.

Whoever you are.

Expect more of these. Maybe.
