<h3>Ideation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://mindnode.com/">Mind Node</a>
    <p>This is an awesome way to think visually, especially when mapping out complicated relational scructures, like web app flows and user stories.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_dotPad.shtml">A sketchbook</a>
    <p>For any thinker this is an old standby, I have tons of em. I think there are three in my backpack right now. The best way to quickly capture and iterate through ideas, great for explaining things to people, letting them explain things to you, and more! I have a tendency to use notebooks as mousepads.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Organization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>
    <p>If I could only recomend one tool or app to anyone it would be Trello. If you use this, it will change your life. No joke. This is an orgaisational tool for your collaborators, your projects, your goals, your life. Organize everything. Srsly bro.</p>  
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://learn.googleapps.com/calendar">Google Calendar / iCal</a>
    <p>Although Trello does have a calendar of sorts, it's more focused around due dates as opposed to making appointments with people, so it can be pretty helpful to have fluency with sheduling apps.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
    <p>Do you like your things? Now you can have your things. Everywhere. I know Dropbox is not the cheapest solution out there, but the workflow, stability and compatability are off the charts. I have a free account and have been working for a while to get extra space here and there. My account is up to 26GB (it starts at 2 :)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>
    <p>I use invision at work, and when I do projects with other people where we need to keep track of ui changes overtime and collaborate on iterations.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
    <p>We use github at work to collaborate on all our code. I use it to host this blog, and I also use it to host code samples from my YouTube channel DevTips. You should subscribe to that.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://layervault.com">LayerVault</a>
    <p>Think: github for creative files. I really like that becuase my files are version-controlled, I can delete things freely, and If I liked an old idea I just go back in my versions and find it. As opposed to hiding a layer becuase I dont want to follow that idea, but I don't want to throw it away. It just gives me a lot more confidence, and smaller file sizes.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://learn.googleapps.com/gmail">Gmail</a>
    <p>I use the web interface for gmail. I don't use the Apple Mail app on my computer, it's always problematic and you end up with tons of diskspace eaten up by attachments. Gmail has gotten so good (a pretty) that it's preferable to a native app. Compound those reasons with the fact that it is pretty tightly wound with google calendars, docs and hangouts ... well, you got a winner.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a>
    <p>A video chat application that is intertwined with your email, text-chat, and you can make YouTube videos directly with it. Did I mention the iPhone app is awesome? Such Google, very video chat, wow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>
    <p>Yes, I use photoshop. No, I don't believe it's the only solution. But I also think that people who skip a graphic program and go straight to the browser everytime are a bit premature. Designing in code is not as flexible as photoshop, not yet. And you can tell by looking at them if the site was designed in the browser. I have opinions on the topic, but the funny thing is this article was created in the browser. But let's be honest: it shows, doesn't it?</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a>
    <p>I like Illustrator. I'm kinda gnarly with a pen tool. I think I could drop old Illy, but since its part of the Adobe CC, why not? I use it here and there. Mostly for icons and junk, logos, whatever.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://xscopeapp.com/">Xscope</a>
    <p>I think this is a great tool for anyone making websites. Especially engineery types who dont want to open photoshop when they get mockups from a designery person. With Xscope you can take quick measurements, set up guides that run across your screen, and sample colors like woah. It's really great. Whenever I show it to developers their eyes light up!</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/">Keynote</a>
    <p>Keynote is awesome, and the new update is easier than ever to use. (Let me hear you say centered artboard! woot!) I use it all the time to comunicate ideas. If I want to tell my boss what I'm trying to accomplish, just make a three slide keynote. Easy! Businessy-types get all excited when you show them a slideshow, haha. I also use Keynotes awesome animation engine to make little movies that I include in my YouTube videos all the time. It's really super duper!</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="">FontCase</a>
    <p>Before he made the graphics app Sketch, the guy from Boheniam Coding made FontCase. I really like it as a way to organize and search my fonts for a project. I love that you can specify a font library location, making it possible to put your font library in Dropbox, allowing you to take your fonts everywhere you go! [Edit: looks like they removed this app, oops!]</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/introducing-loremify/">Loremify</a>
    <p>When you need some Lorem quickly this dasboard widget has your back.</p>
  </li>

<h3>Dev Environment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="">my phone/tablet/browser</a>
    <p>[insert impressive stats about mobile usage this quarter] See? Gotta be on it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">MAMP</a>
    <p>Great for when I'm working on a project that needs an apache server and a local database, like Wordpress. Super simple and powerful. Love it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/10-terminal-commands-that-every-mac-user-should-know--mac-4825" target="_blank">Terminal</a>
    <p>I'm just learning, and I'm still quite clumsy in Terminal, but It's super important to new workflows, so I'm forcing myself.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a>
    <p>The best way to write CSS. I love it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="" target="_blank">CodeKit</a>
    <p>Sometimes I use codekit to compile my sass, and other things, but not all the time, and less and less as I get better in the terminal. It has the best livereload feature I've used.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://bourbon.io/" target="_blank">Bourbon</a>
    <p>Bourbon is a super awesome and lightweight SASS Mixin library that does a ton of cool and handy stuff.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>
    <p>I've never written javascript without using jQuery in some way. It's essential for me.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>
    <p>Wordpress is my CMS of choice for people who need a CMS. It's really great software, and its so ubiqutious that you can count on most clients to have some degree of familiarity with it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>
    <p>Jekyll is my new website CMS of choice. It is awesome for a lot of reasons. <a href="">I made a video about it.</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/" target="_blank">Tower</a>
      <p>I don't love tower, but it does what it does pretty well. It's a GUI for git, which I need at this point. I'll phase this out as I get better with Terminal, but I still need it now.</p>
    </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>
    <p>I like Chrome, but I prefer Safari. The problem is that the lastest version of Safari ruined the dev tools, so it's kind of unusable for me.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="http://livereload.com/" target="_blank">Live Reload</a>
    <p>I use livereload right now in a kinda hacky way. It's supposed to auto refresh your browser as you work, but I'm still working out the kinks in my workflow. Sometimes I don't use it as it can be more hasle then its worth...</p>
